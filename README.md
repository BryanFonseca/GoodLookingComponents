# GoodLookingComponents
This repository is a collection of some interesting components I've come across while looking for inspiration.

This is not intended to be a Framework or similar but an opportunity for me to practice the CSS I've been learning as well as getting used to writing modular CSS following BEM conventions (most of the time at least) while using a Pattern Library (KSS in this case) to keep things organized.
